Bad smells are signs of potential problems in code that may adversely affect the maintenance of software. They make a system difficult to change, which may in turn introduce bugs. Bad Smell detection is a time consuming work for software engineers despite proposals on bad smell detection and refactoring tools. They are detected, in general, using quality metrics that formalize some symptoms based on detection rules.  In this project, we have extracted the data from Github repositories and analyzed it. Potential bad smells have been mined from the data and an infographic representation of it has been done.
